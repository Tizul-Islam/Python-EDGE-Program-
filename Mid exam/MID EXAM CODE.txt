1. Write a Python program that takes a string as input from the user and prints the string in reverse order.


2. Write a Python program that takes a variable as input and prints its data type.


3. Write a Python program to evaluate an arithmetic expression taken as a string input (e.g., "3 * (2 + 5)") using the eval() function.


4. Write a program that takes two numbers as input and uses comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=) to show their relationships.


5. Write a program to check if a number is prime or not.


6. Create a guessing game where the program generates a random number, and the user has a limited number of guesses. Use a loop and conditional statements.


7. Write a program to calculate the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers. Input the list as space-separated numbers, and output the results.


8. Write a program to calculate the union, intersection, and symmetric difference of two lists. Take the lists as input from the user.


9. Write a program to convert a list of tuples (e.g., [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')]) into a dictionary and then sort the dictionary by its keys.


10. Write a program to read a text file, count the frequency of each word, and save the results into another file. Use file operations to implement this.











1. Reverse a string

string = input("Enter a string: ")
print("Reversed string:", string[::-1])

2. Print data type of a variable

variable = input("Enter a variable: ")
try:
    eval_variable = eval(variable)
    print("Data type:", type(eval_variable))
except:
    print("Data type: string")

3. Evaluate an arithmetic expression

expression = input("Enter an arithmetic expression: ")
try:
    result = eval(expression)
    print("Result:", result)
except:
    print("Invalid expression")

4. Compare two numbers

num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
print(f"{num1} < {num2}: {num1 < num2}")
print(f"{num1} > {num2}: {num1 > num2}")
print(f"{num1} <= {num2}: {num1 <= num2}")
print(f"{num1} >= {num2}: {num1 >= num2}")
print(f"{num1} == {num2}: {num1 == num2}")
print(f"{num1} != {num2}: {num1 != num2}")

5. Check if a number is prime

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num > 1:
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            print(f"{num} is not a prime number")
            break
    else:
        print(f"{num} is a prime number")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not a prime number")

6. Guessing game

import random
number = random.randint(1, 100)
attempts = 5
print("Guess the number between 1 and 100. You have 5 attempts.")
while attempts > 0:
    guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
    if guess == number:
        print("Congratulations! You guessed it right.")
        break
    elif guess < number:
        print("Too low!")
    else:
        print("Too high!")
    attempts -= 1
if attempts == 0:
    print(f"Sorry, you're out of attempts. The number was {number}.")

7. Calculate mean, median, and mode

from statistics import mean, median, mode

numbers = list(map(float, input("Enter space-separated numbers: ").split()))
print("Mean:", mean(numbers))
print("Median:", median(numbers))
try:
    print("Mode:", mode(numbers))
except:
    print("No unique mode found")

8. Union, intersection, and symmetric difference of two lists

list1 = list(map(int, input("Enter space-separated elements for list 1: ").split()))
list2 = list(map(int, input("Enter space-separated elements for list 2: ").split()))
set1, set2 = set(list1), set(list2)
print("Union:", list(set1 | set2))
print("Intersection:", list(set1 & set2))
print("Symmetric Difference:", list(set1 ^ set2))

9. Convert list of tuples to dictionary and sort by keys

tuples = eval(input("Enter a list of tuples (e.g., [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')]): "))
dictionary = dict(tuples)
sorted_dict = dict(sorted(dictionary.items()))
print("Sorted dictionary:", sorted_dict)

10. Count word frequency and save to a file

input_file = input("Enter the input file name: ")
output_file = input("Enter the output file name: ")

with open(input_file, 'r') as file:
    text = file.read()
words = text.split()
word_count = {}
for word in words:
    word_count[word] = word_count.get(word, 0) + 1

with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
    for word, count in word_count.items():
        file.write(f"{word}: {count}\n")

print(f"Word frequencies saved to {output_file}.")
